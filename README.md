## Introduction

The Elevator System Project simulates an elevator control system that efficiently manages multiple elevators in a building. Whether you're dealing with high-rise office buildings or residential complexes, this project provides a scalable solution to handle elevator requests smoothly and effectively.

## Key Features
- **Efficient Elevator Dispatching**: Uses advanced algorithms to minimize wait times and optimize elevator movements.
- **Dynamic Command Handling**: Allows adding commands dynamically with checks to ensure the best service.
- **State Management**: Elevators seamlessly transition between different states (e.g., moving up, moving down, receiving orders).

## Design Patterns

### Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is employed to handle different distribution strategies for elevator requests. This allows the system to switch between various algorithms, such as First-Come-First-Serve or Same-Direction-Priority, without altering the core logic.

Classes implementing the Strategy Pattern:
- `Distributor` interface
- `FirstComeFirstServeDistributor` class

### Command Pattern

The Command Pattern encapsulates requests as objects, allowing parameterization of other objects with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging the history of requests. This pattern is used extensively for elevator commands to add, move, and execute various elevator operations.

Classes implementing the Command Pattern:
- `ElevatorCommand` interface
- Various command implementations like `AddCommandAsFirst`, `MoveToCommand`, `ReceiveCommand`, etc.

## How It Works
1. **Initialization**: The system initializes with a specified number of elevators and floors.
2. **Command Handling**: Commands such as moving to a floor or picking up a passenger are added dynamically based on real-time input.
3. **State Management**: Elevators change states based on their current activities and command queue, ensuring smooth transitions between operations.

## Usage

**Start the System**:
```
java -jar AVSystemIsTheBestButYouNeedAleksToBecomeBetter.jar <number_of_elevators> <number_of_floors>
```

**Example:**
```
java -jar AVSystemIsTheBestButYouNeedAleksToBecomeBetter.jar 4 10
```

**Commands**:
- **Order Elevator**: `pickup <floor number> <direction>`
- **Next Step**: `s`
- **Stop the System**: `stop`

Commands can be entered in the console to simulate real-time elevator requests and operations.

## Why This Project Rocks
- **Scalability**: Easily handles multiple elevators and complex request patterns.
- **Flexibility**: The use of design patterns ensures the system is easy to extend and modify.
- **Efficiency**: Intelligent algorithms minimize wait times and optimize elevator usage.
- **Maintainability**: Clean, well-structured code makes it easy to understand and maintain.

## Conclusion

This Elevator System Project demonstrates the power of good design and the effective use of design patterns. It's robust, efficient, and ready to tackle any elevator dispatching challenge. Whether you're a developer looking to understand the implementation of design patterns in a real-world scenario or a building manager in need of a reliable elevator system, this project has got you covered.

Enjoy the ride! ðŸŽ‰
